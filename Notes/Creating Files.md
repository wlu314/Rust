In terminal:
~~~
cargo new "file name"
~~~

This creates a new directory with a package manager. You can use a cargo to build new project and external dependencies.

.toml holds metadata for the package. Within the src folder, main.rs is the entry point of running a program.

cd into the File Name
~~~
cargo build
~~~

This will run main.rs
~~~
cargo run
~~~
